# Evolution
Final project for Object-Oriented Development, Fall 2022

Instructions: in teams, write a C++ program that defines a constructor and at least 4 other classes, and has at least 1 instance of class inheritance and a private variable.

Evolution is a program that demonstrates our team's understanding of certain characteristics of Object-Oriented languages, such as class inheritance and private variables. It uses a constructor, "Plant", and 4 classes, each with instances of inheritance, to reflect the evolution of plants ("Algae" is a parent class to "Mosses", because mosses evolved from algae, and so on). We defined public functions in each class to be inherited by the next child class, depicting how plants become more complex as they evolve. Most classes also have their own private variables to represent unique characteristics that each stage has. The program prompts the user for input so they can choose which plants they want to read about and see the differences between the stages of plants as they evolved.

My Responsibilities:
• Help design the layout of the program
• Help research and gather information about the different evolutionary stages of plants
• Create the constructor and help write the 4 remaining classes
• Write the main function
